## Introduction

In this repository, we delve into the principles of Category Theory to enhance our understanding and implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Our goal is to present these concepts in a manner that is accessible and beneficial for both machine learning practitioners and theorists.

## Background

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Key components include:

- **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.
- **Environment**: The external system with which the agent interacts.
- **Actions**: The set of all possible moves the agent can make.
- **Rewards**: Feedback from the environment to evaluate actions.
- **Policy**: The strategy that the agent employs to determine actions based on the current state.

### Category Theory

Category Theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with abstract structures and relationships between them. It provides a unifying framework that can describe and analyze different mathematical concepts using objects and morphisms (arrows). Key concepts include:

- **Objects**: Abstract entities representing data points or states.
- **Morphisms (Arrows)**: Relationships or transformations between objects.
- **Functors**: Mappings between categories that preserve their structure.
- **Natural Transformations**: Ways to transform one functor into another while respecting the structure.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key concepts and experiments.
- `data/`: Datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `examples/`: Example scripts showcasing the application of the project.
- `docs/`: Documentation and additional resources.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qquella/Categorical_Machine_Learning.git
